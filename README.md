# Haxor Hacking Simulator Text Game
This code implements a text-based hacker simulation game where you play as a hacker navigating a virtual network, trying to infiltrate systems, complete missions, and upgrade your skills. Here's a breakdown of the game:

Core Gameplay:

Objective: The main goal is to become a renowned hacker by completing missions, cracking systems, and accumulating wealth and reputation.

Exploration: You navigate a network of interconnected systems, each with its own type, security level, files, and potential challenges.

Hacking: You can attempt to "crack" systems to gain access. This involves a chance-based mechanic influenced by your level, tools, and the target system's security.

Missions: The game offers missions with specific objectives, such as stealing data from a corporate network or testing the security of a bank. Completing missions rewards you with money and reputation.

Progression: You earn experience and money, which can be used to upgrade your skills (firewall, encryption, stealth) and purchase tools from a black market.

Risk and Reward: Your actions carry risks. Failed hacking attempts can trigger alerts or traces. Successfully cracking systems and completing missions increases your reputation and rewards.

Key Features:

Command-Line Interface: The game is entirely text-based, using commands like ls, cat, connect, crack, shop, mission, etc., to interact with the game world.

ASCII Art and Visuals: Uses ASCII art to depict systems (home, server, darknet, etc.) and loading bars to enhance the visual experience.

Typing Effect: A typing effect simulates the feel of interacting with a terminal.

Network Map: A map command provides a visual representation of the interconnected systems and their status (cracked or secured).

Inventory System: You can buy items from the shop on the 'sidenet', and they are stored in your inventory. These items enhance your hacking abilities.

Upgrade System: You can upgrade your core hacking skills: Firewall, Encryption, and Stealth, which improve your chances of success and reduce detection risks.

Random Events: The game includes random events that can impact gameplay, such as system updates that weaken security or security scans that increase the chance of detection.

Mission System: The mission command allows you to view and accept missions, which provide clear objectives and rewards.

Status and Information: The status command displays your current level, experience, money, and skill levels. The ls and cat commands allow you to explore files within systems.

Game World:

Home: Your base of operations.

Server1: A basic server with some security.

Sidenet: A marketplace where you can buy tools and upgrades.

Corp_Network: A corporate network with higher security and valuable data.

Bank: The most secure system, representing a high-risk, high-reward target.

How to Play:

Run the Python code.

Use commands to interact:

help: Get a list of available commands.

connect <system_name>: Try to connect to a system.

ls: List files in the current system.

cat <filename>: View the contents of a file.

crack: Attempt to crack the current system's password.

disconnect: Return to your home system.

scan: Discover available networks.

upgrade: Improve your skills.

shop: Buy items (only accessible from the sidenet).

mission: View and accept missions.

status: Check your progress.

map: View the network map.

inventory: See your purchased items.

clear: Clear the terminal screen.

exit: Quit the game.

Example Gameplay:

Start at home.

scan to find available systems.

connect server1 to try to access the server.

ls to see what files are there.

crack to try to gain full access.

If successful, explore with ls and cat.

connect sidenet to visit the shop.

shop to see what's available.

shop buy password_cracker to purchase a tool (if you have enough money).

mission to view missions.

mission accept data_heist to start a mission.

connect corp_network to target the corporate network.

...and so on.

Overall:

The game offers a fun and engaging text-based experience for those interested in hacking and cybersecurity themes. It combines elements of exploration, strategy, risk management, and character progression to create a challenging and rewarding gameplay loop. The code is well-structured and relatively easy to understand, making it a good starting point for those interested in learning about text-based game development in Python.
